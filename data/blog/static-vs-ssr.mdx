## Overview

In this blog we will discuss about  two different methods of generating HTML for web pages in a React application: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. Static Generation involves generating the HTML at build time, which is then reused for each request. This method is recommended for pages that can be pre-rendered and is often used in conjunction with Client-side Rendering to bring in additional data. On the other hand, Server-side Rendering involves generating the HTML on each request, which can result in slower performance. This method should only be used if absolutely necessary.







## Pre-rendering

By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.

Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. (This process is called hydration.)

## Two forms of Pre-rendering

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. The difference is in when it generates the HTML for a page.

**Static Generation (Recommended)** : The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request.

**Server-side Rendering**: The HTML is generated on each request.

Importantly, Next.js lets you choose which pre-rendering form you'd like to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

## Static Generation

If a page uses Static Generation, the page HTML is generated at build time. That means in production, the page HTML is generated when you run next build . This HTML will then be reused on each request. It can be cached by a CDN.

In Next.js, you can statically generate pages with or without data. Let's take a look at each case.

### Static Generation without data

By default, Next.js pre-renders pages using Static Generation without fetching data. Here's an example:

Note that this page does not need to fetch any external data to be pre-rendered. In cases like this, Next.js generates a single HTML file per page during build time.

## Static Generation with data

Some pages require fetching external data for pre-rendering. There are two scenarios, and one or both might apply. In each case, you can use these functions that Next.js provides:

1. your page content depends on external data: Use getStaticProps.

2. Your page paths depend on external data: Use getStaticPaths (usually in addition to getStaticProps).

## case 1: Your page content depends on external data

Example: Your blog page might need to fetch the list of blog posts from a CMS (content management system).

To fetch this data on pre-render, Next.js allows you to export an async function called getStaticProps from the same file. This function gets called at build time and lets you pass fetched data to the page's props on pre-render.

## When should I use Static Generation?

We recommend using Static Generation (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages

- Blog posts and portfolios

- E-commerce product listings

- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page ahead of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is not a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In cases like this, you can do one of the following:

- Use Static Generation with Client-side data fetching: You can skip pre-rendering some parts of a page and then use client-side JavaScript to populate them. To learn more about this approach, check out the Data Fetching documentation.

- Use Server-Side Rendering: Next.js pre-renders a page on each request. It will be slower because the page cannot be cached by a CDN, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. We'll talk about this approach below.

## Server-side Rendering

If a page uses Server-side Rendering, the page HTML is generated on each request.

To use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need to export an async function called getServerSideProps. This function will be called by the server on every request.

For example, suppose that your page needs to pre-render frequently updated data (fetched from an external API). You can write getServerSideProps which fetches this data and passes it to Page like below:

![server-side-rendering](/static/blogs/static-vs-ssr/blog1.4.png)

As you can see, getServerSideProps is similar to getStaticProps, but the difference is that getServerSideProps is run on every request instead of on build time.

## Summary

We've discussed two forms of pre-rendering for Next.js.

- **Static Generation (Recommended)**: The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request. To make a page use Static Generation, either export the page component, or export getStaticProps (and getStaticPaths if necessary). It's great for pages that can be pre-rendered ahead of a user's request. You can also use it with Client-side Rendering to bring in additional data.

- **Server-side Rendering**: The HTML is generated on each request. To make a page use Server-side Rendering, export getServerSideProps. Because Server-side Rendering results in slower performance than Static Generation, use this only if absolutely necessary.
